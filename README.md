# DBDLobby-EternalBlight
Full recreation (1:1) of the Eternal Blight (4.3.0) Lobby in Dead by Daylight

V1.1 of the Eternal Blight Lobby mod is available in the Releases tab (.pak file)
Please note this is a WIP version of the lobby and is missing a few fixes.

**V1.1 UPDATE:**

- added missing candle blueprints around the lobby
- improved lighting

**In a future update I hope to add:**

- Eternal Blight Menu Music
- Update Ground Material to 3.6.0 / 4.1.2 (currently, it is using 3.0.0)

**Credits:**

**Oleg / Олег Шабунов#6272 - creating template project, updating SDKs, materials & helping fix bugs/issues. (this would literally be impossible without him.)**

**Pax - Recreating all components/aspects of the Silent Hill lobby 1:1 in Unreal Engine**
